            I'm an AI Engineer who loves building smart systems that actually get things done — turning complex tech into something practical, efficient, and maybe a little magical. I enjoy blending logic with creativity, designing tools that make life easier, more thoughtful, and sometimes even a bit fun.

            Inspired by chefs, animals, and the quiet rhythm of nature, I've learned that curiosity keeps everything moving forward — whether it's in code, cooking, or everyday life. When I'm not fine-tuning models, you'll probably find me reading, experimenting in the kitchen, or finding patterns in the little things that make the world work smarter.
